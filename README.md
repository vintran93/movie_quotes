Installation
To get started with the app, first clone the repo and cd into the directory:

$ git clone git@github.com:vintran93/movie_quotes.git
$ cd movie_quotes
You need to install the gems:

You may need to first run bundle install if you have older gems in your environment from previous Rails work. If you get an error message like Your Ruby version is 2.x.x, but your Gemfile specified 2.4.4 then you need to install the ruby version 2.6.4 using rvm or rbenv.
Using rvm: rvm install 2.6.4 followed by rvm use 2.6.4
Using rbenv: rbenv install 2.6.4 followed by rbenv local 2.6.4
Install gems with bundle install --without production from the rails root folder, to install the gems you'll need, excluding those needed only in production.
Run rails db:create followed by rails db:migrate to set up the database

Install static assets (like external javascript libraries, fonts) with yarn install

To launch the app locally run: heroku local -f Procfile.dev.
